    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <em>You weren’t born to count calories.</em><br /><br />
      You were born to <strong>live fully</strong> —  
      to move, to taste, to laugh, to love.  
      To eat the food you grew up with, chase your kids,  
      climb mountains, run meetings, and dance barefoot in the kitchen.  
      <br /><br />
      But here’s the truth:  
      To live freely, you need a body that can keep up.  
      A system that works <em>with</em> your life, not against it.  
    </p>

    <div className="my-8 border-l-4 border-[#94c159] pl-4 text-lg italic text-[#333]">
      That’s why we exist. <br />
      We don’t just keep you healthy —  
      we keep you <strong>ready</strong> for everything life offers.  
      <br /><br />
      🍽️ Eat what you love. <br />
      🛫 Travel far and often. <br />
      🧡 Be present with the people who matter. <br />
      💪 Look good, feel strong, age boldly. <br /><br />
      And let us handle the wellness plan.
